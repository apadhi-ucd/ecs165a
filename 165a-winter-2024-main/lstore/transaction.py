        - Generates a unique transaction ID
        - Iterates through all queries to acquire appropriate locks

        - Acquires exclusive (X) locks for write operations and intention exclusive (IX) locks on tables
        - Upgrades locks if needed (from shared to exclusive)
        - Aborts transaction if any lock acquisition fails

    Phase 2 - Query execution:
        - Executes each query with appropriate parameters
        - Creates log entries for each operation for potential rollback
        - Aborts if any query fails
        - Adds successful operations to the transaction log

    Phase 3 - Commit:
        - Calls the commit method to finalize the transaction and release all locks
