Milestone 2 Functions and Goals

  Goals:
      Bufferpool - From what I understand the bufferpool it keeps track of most frequent accessed pages, evicts a page 
                   when needed, utilizes pin/unpin and ensures multiple transactions occur concurrently/same time

                   My ideas for each purpose:

                     What to track - Whenever a page is accessed, we can have a variable keeping track of visits and increment each time 
                     and we could compare each page and include the most visited pages in the bufferpool. Starting out we
                     can have bufferpool empty and add the first visited pages into the pool.

                     Eviction - Evicting pages I think the easiest method would to be evict a page with the least visits, and if 
                     there is a tie among number of visits, we can do random or pick the page that hasn't been visited 
                     for the longest time or whatever is easier.

                     Pin/Unpin - When a page is accessed, can set a pin value = 1 and when transaction is finished, set 
                     pin value back to 0. So, we could have something like if page pin = 1 --> dont evict (Essentially
                     this keeps track of which pages are being used)

                     Synchronization - Not sure if we need this in this milestone 

                     Dirty pages - Keep track of updated pages in the bufferpool used when 
                     flush to disk upon replacement or when close() is called and can have something like if all page in 
                     bufferpool dirty val = 0...
